Match ya Skin

This system utilizes Fitzpatrick Scale and Baumann Skin Type Indicator to identify userâ€™s skin type through a personal test provided on the website. Users can search for beauty products, take the personal test, receive their personalized products recommendation, and make purchase directly through the website. There are three main roles in the website:
customer, seller, and admin, each with their specific access and functionalities. The evaluation results indicate that the system are able to help users in selecting the
cosmetic products compatible for their skin profile online. Future improvements suggested by respondents include adding an order shipment tracking feature,
expanding products and categories options, adding sorting by price, filtering by brand, and providing notifications for the number of items in the shopping cart.

The main goal is to help customers choosing the most suitable products for their skin type based on the test results.
